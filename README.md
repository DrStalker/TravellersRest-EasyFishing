# TravellersRest-EasyFishing
A Traveller's Rest mod to make fishing easier.  The following settings can be turned on/off in the config file:

* Fishing minigame progress fills very quickly when fish is clicked on
* Fishing minigame progress does not decrease
* Reduced time before bites, no fake bites
* Instantly catch fish once hooked instead of starting the minigame
